<p>Now that we have the ultimate plumbing tools list, you might be wondering, &ldquo;What plumbing hand tools do I need to start out with?&rdquo; Below is a deeper dive into our plumbing tools list of the best plumbing tools and equipment that will make jobs that you are on as a plumber much easier.</p>
<h3 id="wrenches-1">Wrenches</h3>
<p>One of the most popular tools for plumbing is the wrench. Even though there are over 20 different types of wrenches, there are a few that are most often used in plumbing. All wrenches have a handle and a head. The handles are used to grip the wrench, while the head is what grips onto whatever you&rsquo;re loosening or tightening.</p>
<h4 id="crescent-wrench">Crescent Wrench</h4>
<p>These wrenches have an adjustable jaw which makes it useful when tightening nuts and bolts. Some would argue this is one of the best plumbing tools you could have.</p>
<h4 id="pipe-wrench">Pipe Wrench</h4>
<p>Pipe wrenches can be used for plumbing pipes and hooking up faucets. You should use a pipe wrench because its jaws will wrap around any surface easily. This means you don&rsquo;t need as much force to tighten or loosen the piping.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/Closed_Pipe_Wrench_Best_Plumbing_Tools.jpg" alt="Pipe Wrench On Tool Bench"></p>
<h4 id="adjustable-wrench">Adjustable Wrench</h4>
<p>Adjustable wrenches are one of the most popular tools for plumbing. They can be used for a variety of jobs, such as loosening or tightening bolts. Adjustable wrenches are also easy to use and the jaws can fit around any surface easily.</p>
<h4 id="basin-wrench">Basin Wrench</h4>
<p>This type of wrench has a long handle to give your arm more leverage when tightening plumbing fittings. The basin wrench is also called a &ldquo;sink wrench&rdquo; and can help get into tricky, hard to reach places.</p>
<h3 id="screwdrivers-1">Screwdrivers</h3>
<p>There are many different types of screwdrivers, but our plumbing tools list has a few that focus on plumbing.</p>
<h4 id="hex-screwdriver">Hex Screwdriver</h4>
<p>A must for any plumber’s tool box. Hex screwdrivers are used to turn screws that have six-sided hexagon shaped heads.</p>
<h4 id="philips-head-screwdriver">Philips Head Screwdriver</h4>
<p>The Phillips head screwdriver has a plus shaped blade that is used to tighten or loosen screws with cross-shaped heads. This is considered one of the plumbing hand tools that is used when you don&rsquo;t have access to power tools.</p>
<h4 id="flat-head-screwdriver">Flat Head Screwdriver</h4>
<p>A flat head screwdriver is an essential tool in any plumber&rsquo;s toolbox. This type of screwdriver has a blade that is shaped like a minus sign. This shape is perfect for screws with flat head bits, which are also shaped like the minus sign.</p>
<h4 id="torx-screwdriver">Torx Screwdriver</h4>
<p>These screws are a little different than a hex head &amp; are a little more unique. They are usually black and have six points. Many cabinets that you might encounter use these types of screws.</p>
<h4 id="power-tools-1">Power Tools</h4>
<p>There are a variety of power tools that you might need as a plumber, but our plumbing tool list has some great items to get started with.</p>
<h4 id="shop-vacuum">Shop Vacuum</h4>
<p>This is an all-purpose vacuum that can suck up water or sawdust from your plumbing project to keep your workspace clean.</p>
<h5 id="power-drill">Power Drill</h5>
<p>A power drill is great for drilling holes into walls &amp; other material to use as an attachment point. You can also use the power drill to create a hole through a wall for installing a new pipe.</p>
<h4 id="sawzall-saw">Sawzall Saw</h4>
<p>This is the best way to cut pipes into different lengths. It not only cuts through pipes, but can also be used to cut through other materials like wood or plasterboard. The Sawzall has a very powerful motor and is typically battery operated, making it one of the best plumbing tools available.</p>
<h4 id="pliers-1">Pliers</h4>
<p>Pliers are one of the best plumbing tools that you can&rsquo;t go wrong with having in your toolbox. They come in handy for a variety of plumbing jobs, and are seen as one of the best plumbing tools out there.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/Needle_Nose_Regular_Pliers_Plumbing_Hand_Tools.jpg" alt="Multiple Pliers On Work Bench"></p>
<h4 id="slip-joint-pliers">Slip Joint Pliers</h4>
<p>These are used when you need something more than your fingers, but less than needle nose pliers. These can be helpful in tightening hose clamps and other things that don&rsquo;t require as much precision.</p>
<h4 id="needle-nose-pliers">Needle Nose Pliers</h4>
<p>This is a very popular tool for plumbers because they can be used to grab onto small objects or wires that are difficult to hold with your hands. Needle nose pliers also have an adjustable screw so you can tighten the grip even more if needed. They&rsquo;re one of the best plumbing tools for tight spaces.</p>
<h4 id="channel-locks">Channel Locks</h4>
<p>These are very useful for gripping something that has a flat surface. When you tighten the handles, it creates pressure which can be used to loosen or grip whatever is in its jaws. It&rsquo;s another one of those best plumbing tools that many plumbers often keep on hand.</p>
<h4 id="vice-grip">Vice Grip</h4>
<p>This tool grips onto objects with its jaws. Vice grips can be used to hold onto things when you&rsquo;re working on a plumbing job and don&rsquo;t have anything else available that could work as well.</p>
<h3 id="tapes--adhesives-1">Tapes &amp; Adhesives</h3>
<p>Some of the best plumbing tools that you might want to keep on hand are tapes and adhesives. Tape &amp; adhesives are great for fixing plumbing pipes when they&rsquo;re leaking from the threads &amp; seams.</p>
<h4 id="silicone">Silicone</h4>
<p>Silicone is a great type of adhesive for plumbing jobs because it bonds very well to most surfaces. When silicone is applied, the first thing that happens is that it becomes tacky until it dries. Once dry, you&rsquo;ll find that silicone will create a seal on corners to prevent leaking.</p>
<h4 id="plumbers-tape">Plumber’s Tape</h4>
<p>Plumbers tape, also known as thread sealing tape, is a very useful type of tape when it comes to plumbing jobs. This type of tape is used to patch leaks and seams in plumbing pipes. It&rsquo;s often white and is wrapped directly around the threads of a pipe. Each color has different applications so be sure to get the right one!</p>
<h4 id="colors-of-plumbers-tape">Colors Of Plumber’s Tape:</h4>
<p><strong>White</strong> - This is good for a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pink</strong> - This is ideal for plumbers &amp; is heavier duty than the white tape.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow</strong> - This type of plumber’s tape is for all types of gases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>propane</li>
<li>butane</li>
<li>natural gas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Green</strong> - Used specifically for oxygen lines &amp; is grease free.</p>
<p><strong>Grey</strong> - Used for stainless steel, this will prevent your pipes from seizing together &amp; is ideal for the coarse threads of a stainless-steel pipe.</p>
<p>The strength of every type of thread sealing tape comes from its ability to stick to wet surfaces, while still being able to peel off easily if you need to reapply.</p>
<h4 id="pipe-cement">Pipe Cement</h4>
<p>Pipe cement is a type of plumbing adhesive that&rsquo;s typically used when you are trying to join pipes without threads. Pipe Cement is the most common type of glue used for plumbing connections, and it has been in use for years. It gets tacky when air touches it, which makes it easier to form a stronger bond between two pipes.</p>
<h4 id="duct-tape">Duct Tape</h4>
<p>Duct tape is a type of plumbing adhesive that&rsquo;s often used for waterproofing. It can be applied to just about anything, and is very easy to remove if you need to replace something or take it down. This type of tape is versatile enough to work for just about any plumbing job.</p>
<h3 id="plumber-specific-tools">Plumber Specific Tools</h3>
<h4 id="snake-tool-kit">Snake Tool Kit</h4>
<p>A snake tool kit is most often used to clear drain clogs. This plumbing tool can be helpful if you have a clog in your drain pipe that&rsquo;s not allowing any water or waste to pass through.</p>
<p>This kit is inserted directly into the affected drain &amp; should pull the clog right out, or break it up so it flushes through the line.</p>
<h4 id="plunger">Plunger</h4>
<p>A plunger is another plumbing tool that&rsquo;s often used to clear clogs. This type of plumbing tool can be inserted directly into the drain &amp; should push out whatever has been blocking it.</p>
<p>The most popular plunger types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat/Sink</li>
<li>Accordion</li>
<li>Flange</li>
</ul>
<p>Our experts suggest that you may need to use them in combination when the clog is really bad.</p>
<h4 id="pex-piping">PEX Piping</h4>
<p>PEX piping is a type of plumbing pipe that&rsquo;s used for connecting water supply lines. These pipes are often made with synthetic rubber, and have been around since the 1970s. They&rsquo;re flexible which makes them more resistant to breaking in comparison to steel or copper pipes.</p>
<h4 id="pipe-fittings">Pipe Fittings</h4>
<p>Pipe fittings are a type of plumbing tool that is used to connect pipes. These pipe fittings seal the connections that are typically used to change the direction of the piping. When installed properly they will help prevent leaks and clogs from developing in your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Our experts recommend using these for all types of connections - whether it&rsquo;s between two PVC or copper pipes, or an outdoor faucet with a waterline.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/PVC_Pipe_Fittings_With_Pipe_Cement.jpg" alt="PVC Pipes With Joints Connected With Adhesive"></p>
<h4 id="pipe-threader">Pipe Threader</h4>
<p>A pipe threader is a plumbing hand tool that&rsquo;s used to help you connect pipes together. This type of plumbing tool will cut grooves or threads on a new piece of pipe, which is typically metal. These threads are perfect for connecting pipes together in order to change the direction of a plumbing system or for repairing leaks.</p>
<h3 id="pipe-cutter">Pipe Cutter</h3>
<p>A pipe cutter is a type of plumbing hand tool that&rsquo;s used when you need to cut pipes to size.</p>
<p>A pipe cutter will cut all types of material including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copper</li>
<li>PVC</li>
<li>ABS</li>
<li>PEX</li>
<li>Steel</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of tool will have two halves which are hinged on one side while they&rsquo;re clamped tightly around with a metal blade to score the pipe. After the plumbing hand tool is moved around in a circular motion, it will begin to cut through the pipe.</p>
<h4 id="hacksaw">Hacksaw</h4>
<p>A hacksaw is a plumbing hand tool that&rsquo;s also used to cut pipes. This type of plumbing hand tool will typically be made from metal and have an adjustable blade, which can make it easy to get the perfect size cuts every time.</p>
<p>Hacksaws are often used for cutting copper pipes or steel piping because its blade is designed for metal-to-metal contact.</p>
<h4 id="torch">Torch</h4>
<p>A torch is a plumbing hand tool that&rsquo;s used for heating pipes. This type of plumbing hand tool will be set with an open flame, which can make it easier to heat the inside of metal pipes in order to bend or cut them more easily.</p>
<p>This type of tool should not be left unattended and must always have a water source nearby incase the flame gets out of hand.</p>
<h4 id="wire-brush">Wire Brush</h4>
<p>A wire brush is a plumbing hand tool that&rsquo;s usually used to clean your work areas surface. This type of plumbing hand tool can be inserted into the pipe, and then rotated in order to scrub away any debris or buildup inside it. It can also be used on the outside of the pipe to remove rust or build up.</p>

<h3 id="safety-accessories-1">Safety Accessories</h3>

<h4 id="ear-protection">Ear Protection</h4>
<p>Ear protection is another important safety accessory. This will help you protect your hearing and prevent any long-term damage from occurring as a result of loud noises or constant exposure to noise at high levels. While operating some of the plumbing hand tools above, like the hand drill or Sawzall, it’s advised that you should be wearing ear protection.</p>

<h4 id="gloves">Gloves</h4>
<p>We recommend that you always wear gloves when working on plumbing projects - whether it&rsquo;s to protect your hands or not spread bacteria throughout the home due to dirty hands, these are a must have in any toolbox.</p>
<h4 id="knee-pads">Knee Pads</h4>
<p>Knee pads are a piece of safety equipment that you should also be wearing when working on plumbing jobs. This will help protect your knees and lower extremities from any bumps, falls or scrapes while you work. They also provide comfort for the long days working on the floor and under sinks &amp; bathtubs.</p>
<h4 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h4>
<p>A toolbox is a must have when working on plumbing jobs. This will help hold all of your tools and equipment while you work so they don&rsquo;t fall to the ground or get lost. A Toolbox is also perfect for holding all of your plumbing tools and equipment for easy access and keeping your work area safe. A good Toolbox will help keep your tools where they should be when you&rsquo;re on a house call &amp; can&rsquo;t make it back to your vehicle.</p>
