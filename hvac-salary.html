<p>What is the average HVAC worker's salary? Many different people have asked that question, and yet there is no clear answer. What we can do is break down the numbers for you. The average HVAC tech salary is $37,000 per year as of October 2021. This number changes based on the type of work that HVAC techs are doing.</p>
<p>Residential HVAC technician salary is much lower than commercial or industrial because they do not have to deal with the same types of challenges in their work environment. The highest pay for a residential technician is up to $55k per year, while a commercial technician can make up to $68k depending on experience level and company size.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these numbers represent averages, and not everyone makes this much money in their career as HVAC professionals.

<h2 id="what-jobs-does-hvac-technician-do">What jobs does HVAC Technician do?</h2>
<p>HVAC technicians are the people who primarily work on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. HVAC technicians primarily work indoors or outdoors in all types of weather conditions. They are typically employed by contractors, building owners, or companies that provide maintenance services for HVAC systems. HVAC technicians come in two categories: residential and commercial. Each class has its own set of responsibilities to go along with the pay rate you can expect for the type of job.</p>
<p>Industrial or commercial HVAC jobs are usually higher paying because they deal with large systems daily, which means more work hours. Residential work is generally on an hourly basis, while commercial HVAC technicians are mostly paid for how many services they do, which means more money in their pockets if they get called out to a job site often.</p>
<p>Commercial HVAC techs are employed by, for example, hotels, hospitals, or corporate offices, which have large buildings with many air conditioning and heating units. Residential HVAC techs usually work on individual residential homes and apartments.</p>
<p>HVAC techs are responsible for many different tasks, but the main ones include installing and repairing heating systems. They also need to work with other HVAC professionals to help them fix more significant problems. Another essential part of an HVAC technician's job is educating their clients on how to save money by improving the efficiency of their HVAC systems.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-do-hvac-techs-make-a-year-or-an-hour">How Much do HVAC Techs Make a Year or an Hour?</h2>
<p><img src="/hvac/img/time-is-money-100-bills-cash.jpg" alt="hourly wage for HVAC technicians"></p>
<p>The salary of an HVAC technician can vary depending on factors such as location, education, the type of work being done, and experience. A starting salary for an HVAC technician is usually around $27,000 a year. Entry-level HVAC technicians can earn from $24,000 to $30,000 per year. Hourly pay for new entry-level HVAC techs is about $17/hour, and some companies will offer more than that.</p>
<p>HVAC technicians start out working hourly rates, but it is not unusual to see them switch to salary-based work as they gain more experience. Some of the benefits of being a commercial HVAC technician are getting paid more money on top of your salary during busy periods such as the winter season or when air conditioning needs repair in an office or school building.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-do-commercial-hvac-techs-make">How Much do Commercial HVAC Techs Make?</h2>
<p>The entry-level salary for a commercial HVAC technician is around $31.50 an hour, while the most experienced workers make up to $81,021 per year on average. The field service technicians have a median salary of about $45,800 annually, and some companies offer bonuses or commissions as well.</p>
<p>Commercial technicians are paid a higher hourly rate than residential techs. The average pay is between $50-60k per year, depending on the company and their location.</p>
<p>Commercial or Industrial HVAC technician salaries vary from one job to another. Still, We can consider some factors to determine an estimated salary range for industrial workers.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is the company the HVAC technician is working for. There are many different types of companies out there, and each one has a range as far as what they want to pay their employees for HVAC services. Another factor affecting how much a commercial technician gets paid per year is where they live geographically. The cost of living in some areas such as New York and California is much higher than others which means that the pay rate for techs will be different.</p>
<p>The average salary for a commercial HVAC technician is $37,918 per year in Arkansas. In Minnesota, a Refrigeration Technician's annual Salary comes to about $52k. HVAC Mechanic Salary has a yearly income of nearly 50 thousand dollars, making it one of the highest paying jobs!</p>
<p>You must be actively employed in this role, so your earnings are guaranteed to increase with time!

<p>How much do HVAC techs make in a company? The answer to this question varies from company to company. Some of the top companies that hire HVAC technicians in the United States include:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h2 id="which-state-has-the-highest-demand-for-hvac-technicians">Which state has the highest demand for HVAC technicians?</h2>
<p>The state that has the highest demand for HVAC techs in Texas due to its increasing energy utility projects and high temperatures. This means that both residential and commercial buildings will need regular maintenance services to work efficiently. After Texas, the next state with the highest demand for HVAC techs is California, followed by Florida and then New York.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-factors-affecting-hvac-salary">What are the factors affecting HVAC salary?</h2>
<p>The factors that will affect HVAC salary include geographical location, the size of the company you work for, and your level of education. While each factor plays a role in determining how much money an HVAC technician makes, there are other things to consider, such as the type of equipment you work on and how many years of experience you have.</p>
<p>For example, suppose an HVAC tech works in a large office building like the Empire State Building. In that case, they will likely earn more than someone working for a home because there are higher costs to maintain commercial buildings, especially skyscrapers, which require regular service to keep equipment up to date.</p>
<p><img src="/hvac/img/professional-gas-heating-technician-with-gas.jpg" alt="factors affecting HVAC tech salary"></p>
<p>The average salary for HVAC technicians is around $37k-$40k per year, which means that someone who works in a large office building will likely earn more than this, while those working on residential homes may only make an average of $35,000 or less each year. Another factor that affects how much money you can make in the HVAC industry is your level of education. Someone with a degree or certificate will likely make more money than someone with only an associate's or high school diploma because they can handle complex equipment and know how to work on different systems for commercial buildings and residential homes, which provides more value to a company.</p>
<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The HVAC industry in the United States is thriving. It will continue to grow over the next few years, which is why it's important for people who are interested in this career field to get their HVAC license and certification. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), HVAC technician employment will increase by 15 percent through 2026. This profession allows you to work on different types of equipment across all 50 states. If you love traveling or want a job with plenty of available opportunities, working as an HVAC technician is a great choice.</p>
<p>Hiring managers and companies in the HVAC industry are looking for those with certifications as well as previous experience, so it's essential to get your certification before submitting your resume. If you don't have these things, you can still apply, but employers will be less likely to hire someone without proper credentials to work on commercial or residential buildings.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a steady job that provides good pay, travel opportunities, and the chance to advance your career, then becoming an HVAC technician is an excellent choice. There are plenty of companies to work with, as well as many openings throughout the country.</p>
