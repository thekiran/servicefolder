<h2 id="what-is-hvac">What is HVAC?</h2>
<p>HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. This type of system is used to regulate the indoor temperature by heating or cooling inside air using a furnace and a large fan.</p>
<p>HVAC systems are designed to control the environmental conditions in buildings by heating, ventilating, and air conditioning. These systems are used for residential or commercial purposes. They have three major components: pumps that move water through heat exchangers; fans that blow air across condenser coils; and motors/compressors with refrigerant fluid circulate them.</p>
<p>HVAC/R technicians are in high demand and keep the buildings, homes, and industries running. The need for HVAC/R technicians is so great that it has created a career path with opportunities to work in other areas such as construction or manufacturing. If you think this might be something interesting to pursue, then learn everything about HVAC from all angles before making any decisions on whether or not it's right for you!</p>
