                <b>Fees and Payment terms</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A subscription fee will be charged as per the plans mentioned on
                the pricing page. We strictly comply with the laws of the land and
                we will charge Service Tax at applicable rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Non-payment</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We shall be under no obligation to provide the Service if the
                subscription fee is not paid to us on time. The Account Holder must
                ensure that we have complete and accurate billing and contact
                information throughout the subscription period, including the full
                name of the Account Holder, its business address, and a billing
                contact email address. If subscription fees become overdue we
                reserve the right to suspend your access to the Service until the
                balance is paid and we may close the Account Holder's
                ServiceFolder.com account permanently and disengage ourselves as
                Agent.
            </p>

                <b>Suspension or termination</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you fail to abide by these Terms of Service, or if payment of
                the subscription fees is not paid on time, we reserve the right to
                suspend or terminate your access to the Service. If we withdraw
                access to the Service no refund will be payable by us. One month's
                notice will be given prior to the suspension of an account after
                which time if any issue has not been resolved within the following
                month we will take action to disengage ourselves as your Agent. We
                also reserve the right to close any ServiceFolder.com account for
                any reason, by giving one month's notice. Suspension of your
                account could seriously jeopardize our ability to manage your
                company accounts and could lead to the missing of submission
                deadlines. ServiceFolder.com cannot be held liable for any fines
                incurred resulting from this.
            </p>

                time by contacting us on ServiceFolder@veersoftsolutions.com. No
                further subscription fees will be billed and no refund will be made
                of any subscription fees already billed and paid. You are eligible

                case, you will have to provide a convincing reason for
                cancellation. <br /> At the time of cancellation, you will provide
                your name and address. The amount will be refunded to you with in 7

                that it will be error-free, timely, reliable, entirely secure,
                virus-free or available at all times since we are dependent on the
                reliability of the Internet and your use of your own computer to
                access the Service. We will try to keep any disruptions to a

            <p>
                <b>Exclusion of our liability</b>
            </p>
            <p>You use the Service entirely at your own risk. We do not
                restrict our liability (if any) for personal injury or death
                resulting from our negligence, for fraud committed by us or for
                any matter, which it would be illegal to limit or to attempt to
                restrict. We exclude all other liability and responsibility for
                any amount or kind of loss or damage arising in connection with
                the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Limitation of our liability</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither party shall be liable under this agreement to the other
                party for indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
                damages including without limitation loss of goodwill, whether
                arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise. Where we
                are not legally entitled to exclude our liability, our total
                liability for any loss or damage relating to the Service (or to our
                website generally) shall not exceed an amount equal to the
                subscription fees, which the Account Holder has paid to us in the
                previous month.
            </p>

                <b>Liability to us</b>

            <p>
                If you access the Service using a password created to control
                access to the Account Holder's ServiceFolder.com account, then the
                Account Holder shall be held liable for any reasonable costs and
                expenses incurred by us as a result of breach of these Terms of
                Service by you. Otherwise, you shall be held personally liable for
                any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by us as a result of
                breach of these Terms of Service by you.

            <p>
                These Terms of Service and our Privacy Statement describe the
                entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and

                under these Terms of Service to another party. As Account Holder
                you may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these
                Terms of Service without our prior written consent. Failure at any
                time to enforce any of these terms and conditions or to require
                performance by the other party of any such term or condition shall
                not be construed as a waiver of such provision or affect the right
                of either party to enforce the same. If any provision is held to be
                invalid or unenforceable by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction,
                the remaining provisions shall not be affected and shall be carried
